nn.ipynb was my first go at this, generally just kept as a reference. Will be deleted soon.
nnModel.ipynb generates the model, allowing for dynamic changing of model parameters for easy testing. Shows a loss graph and preds versus reality.
nnExpPreds.ipynb performs the actual function we want to see from this neural network--predicting a set of values over time with only one starting condition. This version compares model preds to the same conditions under the kinetic model.
nnPrediction.ipynb removes the kinetic model entirely and just uses the neural network to predict the future. This is the final version of the model.
